# ShowerToys

A modular desktop productivity utility for Windows inspired by PowerToys, built with C++/Qt. 🛠️

## Description

ShowerToys provides a collection of tools to enhance productivity on Windows. It runs conveniently from the system tray and offers modules like a Macro Manager and local network File/Clipboard Share.

## Features (v1.0)

* **Modular Architecture:** Easily enable/disable or add new utilities (PowerToys style).
* **Macro Manager:**
    * Create macros consisting of multiple actions (Open App, Open URL, Type Keystroke, Open VS Code Folder).
    * Assign global hotkeys (shortcuts) to trigger macros.
    * Edit existing actions within macros.
    * Macros persist between application restarts.
* **Local File Share:**
    * Start a local web server accessible on your Wi-Fi network.
    * Upload files from any device's web browser directly to your PC's Downloads folder.
    * Download files from your PC's Downloads folder to any device via the web interface.
    * Connect easily via URL or QR code.
* **Clipboard Sync (PC-to-Device):**
    * Automatically pushes text copied on the PC to connected web clients or the companion app.
    * (Requires Local File Share server to be running).
* **System Tray Integration:** Runs in the background via the system tray icon.
* **Settings:**
    * Option to start automatically on Windows startup.
    * Selectable application visual style (Theme).

## Installation

* **[Download Installer (v1.0.0)](https://github.com/DoonMad/Showertoys/releases/latest)**

## Companion App

For the best clipboard sync experience (especially reliable background sync), install the optional Android companion app.

* **[ShowerToys Companion Repository & APK Download](https://github.com/DoonMad/ShowerToys-Companion/releases/tag/v1.0.0)**

## Building

* Requires Qt 6 (tested with 6.9.3 MinGW) and CMake.
* Requires the `qrcodegen` and `QHotkey` libraries (included in the `lib/` directory).
* Open `CMakeLists.txt` in Qt Creator and build using a Desktop Kit.

## How to Use

1.  Install and run the application. It will appear in the system tray.
2.  Click the tray icon to open the main window.
3.  Explore modules using the left-side navigation.
4.  **For File Share / Clipboard Sync:**
    * Go to 'Local File Share & Sync Server'.
    * Click "Start Server".
    * On another device (phone, tablet, laptop) on the same Wi-Fi:
        * Open a web browser and go to the displayed URL or scan the QR code for basic file transfer and clipboard viewing.
        * OR: Install and open the Companion App and scan the QR code for better background clipboard sync.

## Known Issues (v1.0)

* Phone-to-PC clipboard sync requires the companion app to be a system app (which is not possible) and is not yet implemented.
* `Type Keystroke` action currently only logs, doesn't simulate keys globally.
